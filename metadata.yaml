description: 'Benvenuto Cellini was a celebrated Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith;
  a passionate craftsman who was admired and resented by the most powerful political
  and artistic personalities in sixteenth-century Florence, Rome and Paris. He was
  also a murderer and a braggart, a shameless adventurer who at different times experienced
  both papal persecution and imprisonment, and the adulation of the royal court. Inn-keepers
  and prostitutes, kings and cardinals, artists and soldiers rub shoulders in the
  pages of his notorious autobiography: a vivid portrait of the manners and morals
  of both the rulers of the day and of their subjects. Written with supreme powers
  of invective and an irrepressible sense of humor, this is an unrivalled glimpse
  into the palaces and prisons of the Italy of Michelangelo and the Medici.'
